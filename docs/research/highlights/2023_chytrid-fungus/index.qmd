<!-- Main panel description -->

::: {.paper-main-column}
Although it’s well documented that native species decline when invasive species are introduced, less is known of how an invasive species can reshape a native species’ ecological niche (i.e. their place and role within an ecosystem). 

Chytrid fungus (*Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*) is an invasive fungus that causes chytridiomycosis disease in exposed frogs, an often-fatal disease that breaks down keratin within a frogs' skin—a vital respiratory organ for frogs. Chytrid fungus was first discovered in Australia in the 1970's and is responsible for over 90 frog extinctions globally.

Scheele et al. (2023) use frog data from the Atlas of Living Australia, GBIF and FrogID to compare niches of impacted and un-impacted frogs in Australia. The authors found that chytrid fungus contracted frogs’ ecological niches, restricting many species to niches with conditions less favoured by chytrid fungus. This finding shows how chytrid fungus can shrink niches and fragment populations, limiting overall species genetic diversity—an important means for frogs to fight disease and repopulate.
