::: paper-main-column
Australia's environment is vast and diverse, but many large areas are difficult to monitor ecologically using on-ground surveys. As the global climate shifts, figuring out where species can find suitable habitat is a pressing issue for scientists and resource managers. Modelled data is of particular importance for decision-makers to understand how future conditions will affect available habitat of Australia's species. These data improve decision-makers' ability to plan and prioritise national- and state-level restoration and conservation initiatives.

In this paper, Archibald & colleagues use species occurrence data from the Atlas of Living Australia, Queensland Museum & CSIRO along with environmental and climatic data to predict potential habitat suitability maps under different climate scenarios for 1,382 terrestrial vertebrates and 9,251 vascular plants at 5 km^2^. These climate scenarios are based on varying levels of potential emission intensities and their projected impact to temperature. 

The [resulting species maps and tables are openly available](http://gigadb.org/dataset/102491) for researchers and managers to improve conservation planning and species management.
